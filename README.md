# Employee Management System

## About This Project
This is my first project for Advanced Programming class. I made a simple console program to manage employees in a company. The program shows how we can use object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance and polymorphism.

## What I Made
I created different types of employees:

### Main Employee Class
- `Employee` (this is the parent class)
  - Has basic info like ID, name, age, etc.
  - Has methods for salary increase and showing info

### Different Types of Employees
1. ProjectManager
   - Keeps track of how many projects they manage
   - Gets extra 300 PLN for each project

2. Analyst
   - Counts how many clients they work with
   - Gets extra 200 PLN for each client

3. Programmer
   - Shows how many technologies they know
   - Gets normal salary increase

4. RemoteProgrammer
   - Shows how far they work from office
   - Gets extra 100 PLN for each kilometer

## What This Program Do
1. See list of all employees
2. See employees sorted by their salary
3. Find specific employee by their ID
4. Give someone a raise
5. Give everyone a raise
6. See yearly budget summary

## Technical Stuff I Used
- Object-Oriented Programming ideas:
  - Inheritance (parent-child classes)
  - Polymorphism (different ways to increase salary)
  - Abstract classes
  - Properties and methods
- Lists to store employee data

## What Is Needed To Run This
- .NET 6.0 (or newer)
- Visual Studio 2022
